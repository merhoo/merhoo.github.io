            <p>
              Visual art depicts the past, and in this paper I want to further
              inform the audience of the works that women artist produced, and
              how it shaped the cultures of their time. The pictures I’ve chosen
              are feminist. They reveal a part of the female experience that
              went undocumented by their male counterparts, that changed gender
              conformity, fought oppression and question the expectations of
              women as artists and as individuals.

        <dt> Investigating Bauermeister's Rainbow </dt>
        <dd class="list__item">
            <p>
              Although Rainbow creates a relationship between the human experience,
              the cellular and celestale, it does not project Bauermeister’s own
              spirituality and experience. Rainbow is valuable in that it is made
              shortly after her artistic voice in the Fluxus movement and the start
              of her lense boxes. It culminates her use of art as a way to change
              our perception of reality, and deviate from absolute truth, adding
              humanity to her intellectualization of her mother’s illness.

              For those of you who are new to programming, or feel a lack of confidence in it,
              my bit on how I became a confident programmer may give you some solace, and solution.

            <p>
              I’m not convinced that time is linear. Occasionally I daydream in class.
              A day passes by as the professor changes slides. My mind often drifts to
              memories or make-believe moments of people who exist only in the past.
              When they drift out of my existence, they stick to my thoughts vividly
              for months or longer. Those strangers we meet can feel familial after
              an initial conversation. Although it is against my logic, they strike
              through me metaphysically. I’m coming to think that the way we perceive
              time is based solely on what we choose to remember...

            Meals remind me of movies. I like meals. Meals with company. Meals without company are so so.
            We make the food or the food is made for us. And we sit down, with plate in front of us.
            And we feel a sense of purpose. Hunger is innate, routine, and this meal wasn’t wrong
            in a way like snacking is. The meal is a part of our day that we attend to. It is a piece of time.
             It is shared in each family household, like Rockwell’s Thanksgiving. Movies are like meals.
             We sit down to eat them. We are hungry, well what are we hungry for?

             This essay is written in a laissez faire style. Partially because
             I’m allowing myself to be stupid. What’s being smart if you never
             had a chance to be stupid. Also because I am (with a french accent)
             lazy.
