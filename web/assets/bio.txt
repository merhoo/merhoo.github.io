This once was a professional site, made with little passion or purpose.
I still am a software developer, nevertheless I've never enjoyed self promotion or praise.
I'm no one special, I'm no one unique, still I felt intrigued to express a piece of me
to the abyss of the Internet. Thank you for giving this place your time, and know that this is not a platform or a showcase, it is my
workspace.
