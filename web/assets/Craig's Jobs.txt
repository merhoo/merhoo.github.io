INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


				 TV ANNOUNCER
		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the
		    world, performs "The Belle of
		    Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

				 CRAIG
		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.
